%capture audio from a YARP stream using mex code to open and close YARP
%ports and grab sound class

%optionally use the excellent Psychophysics Toolbox to stream audio out to
%the local audio device


   
    %how this works:  audioCapture is a mex function that calls a "blocking
    %read" on a YARP port.  This means everything stops until the next
    %frame is fully captured from the audio buffer.  audioCapture then
    %returns a 4 x frameDuration_samples matrix in which the first two rows
    %are left and right audio data, respectively, the third row contains a
    %sample sequence stamp, and the fourth row contains timestamps synched
    %to the PC104.  
    
    %If you're using memory mapping to expose these frames to other
    %instances of MATLAB, it will use a buffer of pStruct.numMemMapFrames.
    %Every time a new frame is read, the columns of the buffer 
    %are shifted left and the new frame is appended.  This way the newest
    %sample is always the right-most sample in the buffer
    
    
    %If all goes well this should execute with plenty of time to
    %call audioCapture() again on the next loop before the next frame is
    %fully captured. Use tic() and toc() to test (warning: tic() and toc()
    %don't work well on Windows, but do work well on any UNIX including Mac
    %OS)



%build a data structure of parameters to keep things organized
pStruct.streamAudioOutput = 0; %flag to toggle on streaming
pStruct.writeToMemMap = 1;  %flag to toggle on writing stereo signal to local shared memory (use this to expose the signal to other MATLAB instances)

%set up some parameters of the audio grabber.  Careful: some of this is
%hard coded into the mex function.
pStruct.sampleRate=48000;
pStruct.frameDuration_samples = 4096;  %must match the settings in the mex function. should be integer multiple of the page size to keep memory access fast
pStruct.frameDuration_seconds=pStruct.frameDuration_samples/pStruct.sampleRate;

    PsychPortAudio('FillBuffer', paoutput, pre);
    pause(1); %give PsychPortAudio a moment to compose itself
    playbackstart = PsychPortAudio('Start', paoutput, 0,0,1); %start the stream playing back
    nextSampleStartIndex=1;
