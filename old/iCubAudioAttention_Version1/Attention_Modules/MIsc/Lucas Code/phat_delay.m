function delays = phat_delaysum(waves, fs, refIdx, margin)
%y = phat_delaysum(x, fs, refIdx, vMargin) returns a waveform obtained by
%delaying and summing the supplied input waves. Cross-channel time-delay 
%estimation (TDE) is performed using PHAT-weighted generalized 
%cross-correlation.
%
%Arguments:
%   x: cell array containing the input waveforms.
%   fs: sampling rate (in sps).
%   refIdx: index of the reference channel.
%   margin: search range for the maximum correlation lag (in seconds).

%This script is based on ArrayProcessor.m written by Tuomo Pirinen in spring
% 2004. It was modified by Marc Ferras in June 2005 to implement PHAT-GCC
%time-delay estimation.
